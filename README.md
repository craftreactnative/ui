## Overview

CraftReactNative provides production-ready React Native components designed specifically to work with Unistyles. Instead of installing a package, you copy the component code directly into your project, giving you full control and customization.

**Note**: This is a community project and is not officially affiliated with the Unistyles team.

## Features

- **Unistyles-optimized**: Components leverage Unistyles' theming and performance benefits
- **Copy-paste approach**: Own your code, no dependency lock-in
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed components with IntelliSense support
- **Theme-aware**: Built-in dark/light mode support
- **Customizable**: Modify anything without breaking updates

## Prerequisites

```bash
npm install react-native-reanimated@^3 react-native-gesture-handler@^2 react-native-svg@^14 react-native-unistyles@^2
